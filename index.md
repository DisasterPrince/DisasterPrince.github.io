## About Me!

I'm DisasterPrince! I also go by Landen, but please stick to calling me DP. I just really appreciate it. <br>
Survivor is pretty much my life. I just... love it. I love it too much. <br>
I'm 17. I'm a cis guy (he/him) and I'm bisexual. I really like maple donuts, and cuddling, and pandas. <br>
I get far too emotionally attached and act far too detached. :) Read my work please! I love comments <3
